I'm Matt Jefferson, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on artificial intelligence, technology, and software development.

I'm particularly interested in practical AI applications, developer tooling, and how artificial intelligence is transforming the way we build software. Whether it's exploring new AI models, integrating AI into existing systems, or discussing the implications of AI in our daily work, you'll find it all here.

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing insights on this exciting journey into the future of AI and technology!
